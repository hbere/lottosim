		<!-- <h2>About the Lottery Simulator</h2> -->
		<p><strong>Lottery tickets almost always lose, but lotteries are thriving.</strong> Why do we waste
			our money buying what are basically expensive receipts?</p>
		<p>Enter this free lottery simulator. Try it on your phone the next time
			you're thinking about	buying an actual lottery ticket. It is designed to mimic the experience of
			playing a real-life lottery once, or even millions of times, for free.
			Play the simulator, and save your money for something that truly matters to you.</p>
		<p>Together, we can save the billions of dollars we spend on lottery tickets every year,
			hard-earned cash exchanged for dreams of riches that come true for almost nobody.
			We can save the $1 or $2 or more that each lottery ticket costs these days,
			for what almost always end up being just small pieces of paper.
			We cheat ourselves when we buy lottery tickets. The hope we feel when we buy
			lottery tickets is fake because when that money is gone, we have fewer means
			to pursue our real hopes and dreams.</p>
		<p>Skipping the lottery is one step towards living a life of greater freedom and
			fulfillment. Enjoy the simulator, and please share it with others!</p>
		<hr />
		<p><strong>This lottery simulator uses the <a
		href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript" target="_blank">javascript</a>
		function <a
		href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random" target="_blank">Math.random()</a></strong>
		to generate its numbers. The numbers are <em>pseudorandom</em>: they follow a
		pattern complicated enough that they appear random to us, but they are not
		truly random because they are generated by a computational algorithm that,
		given the same initial conditions, would always produce the exact same results.</p>
		<p>Ever wonder how real lotteries today generate their
		numbers? Here's one example, as described in the May 3, 2018 New York Times
		Magazine article <a
		href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-iowa-lottery-fraud-mystery.html" target="_blank">"The
		Man Who Cracked the Lottery"</a>:</p>
		<blockquote
		cite="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/03/magazine/money-issue-iowa-lottery-fraud-mystery.html">
		The computer takes a reading from a Geiger counter that measures radiation
		in the surrounding air, specifically the radioactive isotope Americium-241.
		The reading is expressed as a long number of code; that number gives the
		generator its true randomness. The random number is called the seed, and the
		seed is plugged into the algorithm, a pseudorandom number generator called
		the Mersenne Twister. At the end, the computer spits out the winning lottery
		numbers. </blockquote>
